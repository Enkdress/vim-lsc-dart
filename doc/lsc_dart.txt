*lsc-dart*  Language Server Client config for Dart

INTRODUCTION                                    *lsc-dart-intro*

vim-lsc-dart configures the vim-lsc plugin to run the Dart Analysis Server for
`dart` and `yaml` file types. This plugin requires either `dart` or `flutter` to
exist on your path.

See https://github.com/natebosch/vim-lsc for information about the vim-lsc
plugin.


CONFIGURATION                                   *lsc-dart-configure*

                                                *lsc-dart-configure-log*
                                                *g:lsc_dart_enable_log*
Enable the Analysis Server instrumentation log file by setting
`g:lsc_dart_enable_log` to `v:true`. When enabled the analysis server will write
a log to a new temp file. This file will get cleaned up at vim exit.

                                                *g:lsc_dart_enable_completion_ml*
Enable the machine learning model for completion by passing the
`--completion-model` flag pointing to the `bin/model/lexeme` directory in the
SDK. Defaults to `v:true`, set to `v:false` to disable machine learning
completion suggestions.
